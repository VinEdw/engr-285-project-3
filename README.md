# ENGR 285 --- Project 3

This repository contains my group's work for Project 3 of my Engineering 285 class.
The assignment focuses on decoding Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signals using Fourier analysis.

The document is created using [Typst](https://typst.app/).
A `makefile` is configured to run all the Python scripts in the `scripts` directory and save their text output in the `output` directory.
The scripts and output can then be included in the document as desired.
The `makefile` also compiles the Typst document into a PDF.
